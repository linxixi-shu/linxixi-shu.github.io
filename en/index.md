## Publications {#publications}

### VisFin: A Scenario-Driven Chinese Multimodal Benchmark for Holistic Financial Understanding (2025)

- Team Member, Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Main Conference
- Innovation: Built the first large-scale Chinese multimodal benchmark dataset covering the full lifecycle of financial front/middle/back office operations. Integrated 8 types of financial image modalities including K-line charts, financial statements, and official seals. Established a three-layer scenario architecture, filling the gap in Chinese financial multimodal benchmarks.
- Contribution: Participated in multimodal LLM evaluation, completed zero-shot testing of 21 mainstream models, responsible for visualization of experimental results, and analyzed error cases.

### Fin-R1: A Large Language Model for Financial Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning (2025)

- Team Member, Submitted to JASA (under review)
- Innovation: Created Fin-R1-Data with 60,000+ chain-of-thought samples, developed lightweight financial reasoning model Fin-R1 using supervised fine-tuning + GRPO reinforcement learning with dual reward mechanism.
- Contribution: Participated in data quality control, benchmark evaluation experiment design, performance comparison analysis, and error case mining.

### FinGAIA: A Chinese Benchmark for AI Agents in Real-World Financial Domain (2025)
